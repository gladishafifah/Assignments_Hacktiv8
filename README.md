# Python For Data Science - Hacktiv8 Assignments
## [Assignment #1 - London Crime Rate Analysis 2008-2016](https://github.com/gladishafifah/Assignments_Hacktiv8/blob/e552971420554e2d0b0f578996370ccba85a7602/PYTN_Assgn_1_MSIB5_GladisHafifah.ipynb)
The goal of this project is to create a data visualization with Python that is as concrete and consistent as possible so as to identify areas/cities and police forces that need to improve their security. Using Kaggle's [London Crime Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/london-crime). This dataset is a record of crimes in large metropolitan areas, such as London, that occur in different patterns. The data includes the number of crime reports by month, LSOA region, and major/minor category from January 2008-December 2016.

Formulate a question and develop a statistical hypothesis test to answer the question. You must show that you are able to make decisions using data in a scientific manner. And importantly, visualize the data. Examples of questions could be:
- What is the change in the number of crime incidents from 2011 to 2016?
- What were the top 3 crimes per borough in 2016?

## [Assignment 2 - Analysis of NYC Property Sales Data](https://github.com/gladishafifah/Assignments_Hacktiv8/blob/7b09378dc6c9ea71ee92aa437001ecc91353ce4c/PYTN_Assgn_2_MSIB5_GladisHafifah.ipynb)
The objective of this 2nd assignment is to analyze descriptive and inferential statistics of property sales data in NYC, with Kaggle's [NYC Property Sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package). This dataset is a record of every building or building unit (apartment, etc.) sold in the New York City property market over a 12-month period.

This dataset contains the location, address, type, sale price, and sale date of building units sold. A reference on the trickier fields:
- BOROUGH: A digit code for the borough the property is located in; in order these are Manhattan (1), Bronx (2), Brooklyn (3), Queens (4), and Staten Island (5).
- BLOCK; LOT: The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a BBL.
- BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT and BUILDING CLASS AT TIME OF SALE: The type of building at various points in time.

## [Assignments 3 - Analysis of Direct Marketing Campaign Portuguese Banking Institution](https://github.com/gladishafifah/Assignments_Hacktiv8/blob/e552971420554e2d0b0f578996370ccba85a7602/PYTN_Assgn_3_MSIB5_GladisHafifah.ipynb)
The data used relates to a direct marketing campaign of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaign was based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access whether the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed ('yes') or not ('no'). The objective of this analysis is to choose the best algorithm to predict the success of the marketing campaign.
